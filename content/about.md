## TL;DR
Hi, I'm Shawn and I like to talk about technology, music, and data. I'm a DIYer,
father of 3, ultralearner, guitarist, musician, software developer, data junkie,
and general technologist. On my site you'll find a mix of those topics, even some stuff that's unreleated.

I hope you enjoy!

## Technology
Currently, the stuff that really interests me are the worlds of Cloud Computing, Serverless, Functional Programming, Data Science and
Machine Learning. In the past I've dealt heavily with the LAMP stack, been a full-stack javascript developer, worked in the dotnet world, worked with ETL systems,
and navigated my way around development in the world of Salesforce.

In 2024, I'm making a big attempt at tech speaking.

## Music
I originally went to college for a Music Education degree (Actually, [Jazz Studies at the amazing University of North Texas](https://music.unt.edu)).
It was the pinnacle of my life-long attempt to learn music and dive deeper into theory, performance, and education. I
still play plenty of guitar whenever my schedule allows, and continue to blend my tech abilities with music education to try
to help others develop deeper understandings of music. I'll consolidate most of my musical edeavors on the "Music" page.

## Data
I have a realtively new love affair with data and how it can be used to highlight relationships, connect people, and really drive
points home. As I get more confident as a software developer, I can't help but enjoy the data story of how things work and what
makes things tick. A lot of what I write about here will be about my journey through Data and how software developers can
utilize it to their best abilities.

## DIYer
I hate not knowing how to accomplish something. I also love to work with my hands. So soon after becoming a homeowner I
spent a bunch of time on YouTube and HomeDepot.com learning how I can do stuff myself. Mostly, it's about learning a new skill
and showing yourself you can accomplish anything. But it also saves a ton of money, and waiting on contractors who
not always care about the quality of work they provide. I'm a firm believer that *if you want something done right, you have to do
it yourself*. DIY work epitomizes this mantra.

## Dad
My journey as a father of three began in 2012, and it's literally the best job I've ever had. My drive, passions, and commitment all
are reflective of how having children has changed me (for the better). Though I'm passionate about many professional endeavors,
God, my children and family always come first. We also have the priviledge of hosting foreign exchange students, something I highly recommend
to anyone who is able to do so.

## Ultralearner
Ultralearning is a concept that's brand new to me but absolutely fascinating. From what I can tell, it was coined by
[Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/). I would imagine a lot of us developers are ultralearners,
it's a fascinating subject and book and I highly recommend you check it out and begin to apply some of the principals to your
upskilling and continued education.
