You should be using dev containers by now. They've been a thing built into VS Code since X.

## What they are
Containers the ideal way to develop applications in the web. You're able to package all the dependencies and apps up into individual containers which can be used to move around to different clouds and environments, and allow for easy scaling using tools like Kubernetes, ECS, EKS, and the like.

Dev Containers are a build up of that which allow for development environments to be entirely packaged up in the same way that finished applications allow. You can have specific versions of runtimes, operating systems, and everything else needed to run your application *exactly* like it runs in production.

## Why they're helpful
