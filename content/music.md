Before I ever got into writing code, I played a lot of guitar. I still do play a lot of guitar, whenever my
kids and other commitments allow. It brings me great joy, and is a lifetime hobby I know I'll enjoy for the rest of my
life.

### Cruise Control
Cruise Control was a group that recorded a record before well all went off to college.
