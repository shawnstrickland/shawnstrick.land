### Educational Internship Program
My high school has an amazing program which was in its infancy while I was a senior in high school. I was able to spend about half of my day my senior year assisting a local middle school band director in his band classes. This instilled a great passion for teaching music in my life, which still hasn't left all these years later.

### Cruise Control
Cruise Control was a group that I recorded a record with before we all went off to college.
